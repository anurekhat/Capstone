    "# Study of Lending Club loans\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club is an online credit marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing for elective medical procedures. Lending Club has provided datasets that contain complete loan data for all loans issued through the specific time period stated, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) , latest payment information and the financial and credit rating information about the loan applicant collected by Lending Club.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    " The Capstone project aims to learn the payment patterns of applicants and build a predictive model that will predict the repayment class of the loan. For this study, the loan repayment type has been classified into three as follows\n",
    " \n",
    "  - **Good loans** - The installments will be always on time and the loan will be fully paid on or before the end of loan term.\n",
    "  - **Bad loans** - The loan will end up in Charge Off and LendingClub will end up in spending for collection and recoveries process.\n",
    "  - **Delinquent loans** - The loan installments will be delayed one or more times but not likely to end up in charge off.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    " We will be considering the LendingClub dataset for the year 2014. At a high level, the dataset contains the below attribute groups. \n",
    " \n",
    "  - *Applicant Identity* - Basic Identity information about the applicant like home state, employment length, home-ownership type etc\n",
    "  - *Applicant Income* - The reported annual income as provided by the applicant and the verification status\n",
    "  - *Loan* - Attributes directly related to the loan like the loan purpose, amount, interest rate, status, payment of various fees etc\n",
    "  - *Credit History* - Attributes collected about the applicant's credit history like no. of bankcard accounts, mortgage accounts, credit balances, debt to income ratio etc\n",
    "  - *Delinquency History* - Attributes collected about the applicant's previous delinquent payments like no. of chargeoffs / collections, no. of accounts past due payment etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The *loan_status* attribute can be one among the following.\n",
    "      - 'Fully Paid'\n",
    "      - 'Current'\n",
    "      - 'In Grace Period'\n",
    "      - 'Late (16-30 days)'\n",
    "      - 'Late (31-120 days)'\n",
    "      - 'Default'\n",
    "      - 'Charged Off'\n",
    "  \n",
    "    The detailed list of attributes can be viewed [ here ] ('https://github.com/anurekhat/Capstone/blob/master/LendingClub/LCDataDictionary2014.xlsx '). \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "###  Data Clean ups, filtering and transformations\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "  - The below attributes have been dropped for further analysis as they are manual text entries that serves more as just informational. \n",
    "      - *emp_title*\n",
    "      - *desc*\n",
    "      - *title*\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "  - There are two available terms for loans - 36 months and 60 months. For this study, we consider only the 36 months term loans as the 60 months term loans initiated in 2014 will be mostly still running as on 2017 and including them may skew the features of 'Charged Off' loans. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The loan records with *total_rec_late_fee* as a non-zero value have been marked as delinquent. i.e If the applicant has ever paid a late fee, that loan is marked as delinquent. Please see the explanation on **Classification** below\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The below date attributes have been converted to the appropriate duration attribute, considering Apr 2017 as the reference date\n",
    "      - *issue_d* converted to *mo_sin_loan_funded* (months since loan was funded)\n",
    "      - *earliest_cr_line* converted to *mo_sin_earliest_cr_line* (months since the earliest credit line was opened)\n",
    "      - *last_pymnt_d* converted to *mo_sin_last_pymnt* (months since the last payment)\n",
    "      - *last_credit_pull_d* converted to *mo_sin_last_credit_pull* (months since the last credit pull by LC)\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - **Imputing Missing Values**\n",
    "      - *last_pymnt_d* (*mo_sin_last_pymnt*) : This attribute is expected to be null when there has not been any installments that were paid. The date is set to May 2017 so that the duration attribute holds the value -1 and these records are considered separate by the model estimator\n",
    "      - *last_credit_pull_d* (*mo_sin_last_credit_pull*) : This attribute is expected to be null when LC has not pulled the credit info of the applicant.

    "      - *revol_util* : This attribute is expected to be null when info is not available. Imputing these to the median\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - **Categorical features** \n",
    "      Categorical features have been converted to the 'One Hot Encoding' format using pandas `get_Dummies()` method\n",
    "      \n",
    "  - The following attributes are not being considered as the 'X' independent variables in the model as these are not expected to impact the outcome variable of loan_class\n",
    "      - *term* : As it will be always 36 months\n",
    "      - *zip_code* : The 3 digit coded value is not expected to impact outcome\n",

    "#### Classification\n",
    "   1. All loan records where *loan_status* is 'Fully Paid' or 'Current' and *total_rec_late_fee* is zero are classified as **Good**\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "   2. All loan records with *loan_status* 'Charged Off' are classified as **Bad**\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "   3. All loan records that have a non-zero value for *total_rec_late_fee* or loan_status is one among { 'In Grace Period', 'Late (16-30 days)', 'Late (31-120 days)', 'Default'} is classified as **Delinquent**. Note that there could be some >Charged Off loans that could have been also delinquent. The Charged off status will take priority in such cases and those loans will be classified as **Bad** \n",

    "The cleaned up dataset has been divided into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. As a first step, a simple logistic regression model has been built using the training dataset. \n",
